//  dbclick event

// The dblclick event fires when a pointing device button (such as a mouse's primary button)
//  is double-clicked; that is, when it's rapidly clicked twice on a single element within a very short span of time.

const boxElement = document.getElementById("box");

// adding a dblclick event listener to the element
boxElement.addEventListener("dblclick", function () {
  alert("doubleClick event is working properly üëç");
});
