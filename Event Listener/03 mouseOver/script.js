// mouseover
// The mouseover event is fired at an Element when a pointing device (such as a mouse or trackpad)
//  is used to move the cursor onto the element or one of its child elements.

const boxElement = document.getElementById("box");

// add a mouseover event listener to the element
boxElement.addEventListener("mouseover", function () {
  alert(
    "you entered in Restricted Area ðŸ™… (mouse over event is working properly)"
  );
});
